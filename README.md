# FinalGame
I want my game to be a christmas themed game. It is going to be a lumberjack that saves christmas by chopping down trees and collecting logs. The player will start in a tree farm and collect as many as he can. After this he encounters an enemy, Krampus. The player has to study his movements and steal the logs that he is using to burn presents. The player is able to hide behind bushes and trees to stay undetected, if he gets caught, game over. Next the player finds an enormous christmas tree that takes 20 chops to take down. The goal for the game is to collect 50 logs and save christmas!!
